# Third-party and processor registry — softn.io

> Maintained by the `security` agent and updated whenever a third party is added. "To verify" cells must be filled in from each vendor's official documents (DPA, privacy policy, compliance page). This registry is not legal advice.

**Why**: every recipient of personal data must appear in the privacy policy, wherever it is hosted. Hosting outside the EU/EEA adds the obligation to mention the transfer and the safeguard covering it (adequacy decision, including the Data Privacy Framework for certified companies, or standard contractual clauses).
